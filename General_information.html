<p>On the upcoming pages, you will be provided with the instructions. Please read them carefully. While reading the instructions, you will be asked a number of comprehension questions. This is to ensure that we have clearly communicated the instructions. You need to answer all comprehension questions correctly to proceed.</p>

<p>You will be asked to perform some tasks. Then, you will be asked to fill out a short questionnaire regarding the study and provide some demographic information.</p>

<p>You will be compensated for completing this study. You will receive a fixed participation fee of 2 EUR. You will receive an additional amount.

You will receive further information about this later.</p>


<p>Your participation will take place entirely on the computer. If you are unclear about the instructions or the process during the study, please contact <u> Sabra.khajehnejad@kuleuven.be </u> and we will be happy to help you.</p>
