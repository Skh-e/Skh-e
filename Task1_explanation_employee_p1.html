<p>The first task is to “decode” numbers into letters using a decoding key shown on the computer screen. Each correctly decoded number generates <b>{{session.DECODE_PAYOFF}} output points for the firm</b>. The more 
    {{if participant.role == 'employee'}} 
    you decode{{else}} the employee decodes{{ endif }}, the higher the firm’s output will be. </p>

<p>Below, you can see a sample decoding key. The decoding key assigns two-digit numbers to the 26 alphabetic characters in a random order. 
{{if participant.role == 'employee'}} You {{else}} The employee {{ endif }} will be asked to decode a series of two-digit numbers using the decoding key given. Note that the decoding key will be different while performing the task.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<P>Decode this number: 42</P>
<p> Based on the decoding key above, the correct answer is <b>A</b>.  </p>
{{ formfield 'answer' label="You will receive a box like below to enter your answer." }}

<p><b>Note that the system is case-sensitive. Turn on your Caps Lock. </b> After you have typed your answer into the answer box, you can click on the “Next” button to decode the next two-digit number. </p>

<p>The decoding task will last for 5 minutes. You can continue decoding until the end of the period or choose to end the task earlier by selecting “END TASK” and pressing "Next" at any point in time. </p>

<p>You will be given 40 seconds to practice the task. This practice round does not generate any output points. It is solely for practice purposes. </p>
<p>The manager will wait in the meantime and read texts for 6 minutes. Once the time is over, the manager will learn the output that you have generated in the decoding task. </p>
