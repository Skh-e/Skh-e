    <p>The first task is to “decode” numbers into letters using a decoding key shown on the computer screen. Each correctly decoded number generates 100 output points for the firm. The more you decode, the higher the firm’s output will be.</p>
    <p>The decoding task will last for 5 minutes. You can continue decoding until the end of the period or choose to end the task earlier by selecting “END TASK” and pressing "Next" at any point in time. </p>
    <p>You will be given 40 seconds to practice the task. This practice round does not generate any output points. It is solely for practice purposes. </p>
    <p>The manager will wait in the meantime and read texts for 6 minutes. Once the time is over, the manager will learn the output that you have generated in the decoding task.</p>
