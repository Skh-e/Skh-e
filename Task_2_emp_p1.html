<p>Now, you will conduct an investment project for the firm. Recall that the project yields <b>a revenue of 2200 points </b> for the firm if it is realized but it entails costs. You will learn the actual costs on the next page. Then, you need to ask the manager for funding in order to realize the project.</p>

<p>The manager will <b>not</b> learn the <b>actual costs</b>; she/he only knows that the project costs can be any whole number <b>between 1 and 2000 points</b>, with all costs being equally likely.</p>

<p>So, you can request any number <b>between the actual costs and 2000 points</b> and the manager will have to approve your request. Next, the project will be realized and the firm will pay the manager the revenue minus the funds requested by you. <b>If the requested funds are higher than the actual costs, you will keep the difference for yourself. The manager will never learn this difference.</b></p>
