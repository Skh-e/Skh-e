<p>The second task is to conduct an <b>investment project</b> for the firm. The project yields a <b>revenue of 2200 points for the firm</b> when it is realized. The project is always beneficial for the firm, but it is unclear how beneficial it is because it entails costs. Only the employee learns the <b>actual costs</b>. You do <b>not</b> learn the actual costs. You only know that the project costs can be any whole number between 1 and 2000 points, with all costs being equally likely. The employee needs to ask you for funding in order to realize the project. Specifically, the employee can request any number between 1 and 2000 points and you will have to approve the employeeâ€™s request. Next, the project will be realized and the firm will earn the <b>revenue minus the funds</b> requested by the employee and pay that amount to you. <b>If the requested funds are higher than the actual costs, the employee will keep the difference for him/herself. You will never learn this difference.</b></p>
