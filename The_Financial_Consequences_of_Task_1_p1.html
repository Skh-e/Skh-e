<p><b>The Financial Consequences of Task 1</b></p>
{{if participant.role == 'employee'}}

    <p>As already explained, each number you correctly decode generates <b>{{session.DECODE_PAYOFF}} </b>output points for the firm. <b>10%</b> of this output will be given to the manager. </p>

    {#(Conditions 1 and 2)#} 

    {{if session.condition == 1 or session.condition == 2 }} 
<p>In addition, by engaging in the task and generating output, you will help a charity. <b>20%</b> of your output will be donated to <b>Greenpeace</b>. Greenpeace is internationally committed to climate protection, biodiversity and peace with more than three million supporting members. In more than 50 countries, including Belgium, regional Greenpeace offices use non-violent actions to protect the natural foundations of life for people and nature and to ensure justice for all living beings.
    Note that after this session, these funds will actually be transferred to the charity. Thus,<b> the more you decode, the more money you will donate to the charity.</b></p>
